- E: less than 40

## Speed Detector

This is a simple JavaScript program that calculates demerit points for speeding violations based on the speed of a car.
The program takes the speed of a car as input and determines the demerit points according to the following rules:

- If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok".
- If the speed is 70 km/h or more, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it assigns one demerit point.
- If the total demerit points exceed 12, the program prints "License suspended".
